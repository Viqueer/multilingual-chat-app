# Multilingua : A real-time multilingual messaging app for everyone.


This is a repository for Multilingua, a web app that enables inter-language communication

## special thanks to @ravi2611gupta for providing the foundation of this project. I really do appreciate you

# What did I change / improve?
I included multilingual support. That is, users who sign up will be able to communicate in whatever language that they have chosen. 
Communication is also enabled between users of different language by implementing a translation feature. A language sent in one language 
is automatically translated to the primary language of the recipient. The receipient can also see the original message in the sender's primary language.

Key Features:

- Real-time messaging using Pusher
- Tailwind design for sleek UI
- Tailwind animations and transition effects
- Full responsiveness for all devices
- Credential authentication with NextAuth
- File and image upload using Cloudinary CDN
- Client form validation and handling using react-hook-form
- Server error handling with react-toast
